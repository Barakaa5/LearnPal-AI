It's fun and doesn't feel like studying! ★★★★★ I'm very excited for the rest of the lessons!★★★★★ A native speaker friend is so impressed what I can say after just 2 hours of learning ;)MuchasGracias. ★★★★★ It’s a very natural way for beginner to learn a new language. It’s amazing that you can create a sentence in such a short time.ELMÉTODO allows you to:► Speak, non-stop, from the very start. ► Produce thousands of practical phrases for daily use.\n► Painlessly absorb structures and vocabulary at A1 level. ► Make rapid progress, without the need to memorise or study in the traditional sense.ALLOWYOURSELFTOBECARRIEDAWAYBYTHEMETHOD.Right from the start, ELMÉTODO engages you in a non-stop spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper.This beautifully simple resource allows you to use and understand basic Spanish in a matter of hours, without the need for tiresome attempts at memorisation or lengthy, grammatical explanations. This is achieved through a expertly designed, world-class methodology that builds up and practices the language in your mind and mouth, step by step, until you are able to form increasingly complex sentences with ease.From the very start, you will be speaking your own sentences, effortlesslyabsorbing structures without even realising it. The method guides you through basic Spanish in a motivating and stimulating way.Recent students put it this way: ★★★★★ I love the easy style of learning. Like a friend or family member teaching you, but better. No stuffy grammar drills, just speaking!                          ★★★★★Outstanding from the very first lesson to the end. The Spanish is challenging and fast moving, and yet constantly revisits vocabulary and structures so that it sinks into long term memory. Explanations are short and yet accommodate for all learning styles. The whole journey has been a world-class introduction into a language I’ve learned to love. ¡Gracias por todo!★★★★★After completing level 1 and level 2 , I am here for level 3 and have already purchased level 4. Does it not prove how good and well organised the courses are! It's Fantastic. Beyond expectation!LEARN SPANISH NATURALLY AND RAPIDLYIn ELMÉTODO as in real life,learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The processcontinues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts. Repeated exposureto new words and structures over time, in a wide variety of situations and associations, means that these are acquiredfor life.HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?ELMÉTODO, level 1, consists of 20 video lessons of spoken Spanish. After everylessonthere is a series of written exercises as well an optional musical task.We will engage you in a spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper. Just speak, speak and speak. You won't stop speaking Spanish from start to finish. This is the ideal system for beginners to learn Spanish.My goal with ELMÉTODOis for you to become hooked on the program, therebymastering basic Spanish as quickly as humanly possible.To your success!",

        'That was cute and fun',
        "This is a refreshing approach to learning Spanish and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is the best money you will spend to learn the beautiful Spanish language.\n\nMy wife is Colombian and we have been together 5 years. In that time I have always had a goal of learning Spanish. However, more 'traditional' means of learning the language have not worked well for me. I have tried meeting with instructors, self-teaching with 'how-to' books, etc. These all end the same; with me giving up in exasperation. That has all changed with The Method.\n\nThis course is cumulative and teaches you useful words and sentence structure from the very first lesson. Peter offers detailed explanations about the 'why\"behind rules of Spanish grammar. Hearing Peter's daughter( a native Spanish speaker) also helps a great deal in teaching correct pronunciation.Additionally, I am learning Latin American Spanish which has some slight differences, in the course differences between the languages are highlighted so you are able to choose which pronunciation to pursue. The rapid sense of progress you experience in the course helps motivate you to continue. My results have been amazing and I have proof that it works.\n\nI am lucky enough to be in Bogotá Colombia while taking this course, so I have been able to verify that my progress is real. I am staying with my mother-in-law and meeting with my wife's Spanish speaking family on a regular basis. I am able to communicate with them much more effectively then prior to the class. They constantly compliment me on the rapid progress and ask how I am improving so quickly. \n\nIf you are learning Spanish and want a better and more efficient method of acquiring the language, one where your progress is not impeded by boring and useless classes, buy this course today and watch your Spanish level rise immediately! \n\nThank you Peter and Jessica!",

If anything, it's confusing me. Other than that I'm having fun and learning relatively quickly. Also, English is not my first language, which lends an added level of complication to proceedings..",

        'This is how language courses should work. Keep talking; incremental progress; constant review and integration with previous lessons. Well done.\n\nUsers should be aware that this course emphasizes European Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish. For the most part you should be OK as long as you substitute the "s" sound for the "th" sound.\n\nMy main recommendation concerns the quizzes.

        "El Metodo is very good. It is easy to follow, the lessons are clear, and the progression is quickly noticeable. I recommend following the advice of doing each lesson at least 3 times. The repetition out loud really helps gain confidence in one's ability. One improvement could be to add some comprehension exercises too, listening to texts that increase progressively in length and complexity. You can find some of those on El Metodo's YouTube channel, however, I often do my lesson's offline without Internet access. As per out loud repetition, I believe that listening to such texts or simple conversations would help gain confidence in understanding and getting used to the Spanish RIP (Rythm, Intonation and Pronunciation). Thanks Peter and Jessica.",

The learning curve is all around conjugations to begin with (even for the beginner level's very first course) - which is actually the challenging part in learning any language.  Peter and Jessica handholds you in assimilating the concepts well and help you learn/remember the words, terms around them. It is like learning swimming on the deep end of the pool, without realizing it. And by the time you realize it, you have leant it already. Thank you Peter, Thank you Jessica.",

        'I LOVE this Spanish Course. After Day 1 I could already say some sentences to my (Spanish) fiancé (he was very surprised!) And now after the entire Level 1 I understand a lot already, I can create my own sentences and I am able to have a conversation in Spanish. Thank you very much Peter for your effort to create this course! It is highly appreciated. And I can highly recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn Spanish. I am happy and my fiancé too. :)',
        'Enjoying so far and learning',
        'I felt excited from the moment I started. It was fun and I already felt as though I’ve had a win and gained confidence in my Spanish accent.',
        'Nice and interesting, can the lecture in YouTube be part of the course here too? so we do not need to go to different platform for more materials.\nAlso, it will be nice to have resources (pdf/text) files for the Time-trial lessons.',
        'Interesting!  Easy to latch onto the words and flow. I like how the lessons are structured, the repetitions and resources are very helpful.\nWas fun learning, actually cannot believe how much I was able to grasp in just 4 hours! Thank you for designing this course, it definitely gave me a foundation and I feel motivated to pursue the next level.',
        'Much more logical progression than other programs or classes I have attempted. Each new word or phrase is easy to integrate into sentences.',
        'Only up to Lesson 7 and so far, OUTSTANDING! Thank you so much~',
        "Love this format. My first time trying a course and I'm glad I chose this one to start with.",

        'muy bien gracias',
        'The images and the step by step process is really good thus far.',
        "I've been teaching English in Taiwan and encountered the difficulty ESL students have with listening and pronunciation. However, they had no difficulty reading and writing. \nYour course does a marvelous bringing together of all four components. I could not believe how effective it is.\nNeedless to say, I've thoroughly enjoyed so far and look forward to the other levels.\n\nThank you and congratulations on a job well done.\n\nBev",
        "I just started but this is awesome! They even give you tips on how to pronounce certain consonant sounds authentically. I'm definitely having fun and want to finish the rest of this course!",
        'good',
        '教學清晰，實用',
        'It’s awesome',
        'Wonderful course to get started speaking spanish right away. I think the repetition is an excellent way to internalise the language. However, I feel like the constant translation can sometimes hinder the train of thought. This is just the first course though, perhaps it will be better subsequently.',
        'Enjoyed :)',
        "great beginning, I'm motivated to continue.",
        'It is quite engaging, and their repeat after me exercises, while repetitive, are really good when it comes to pronunciation learning. Overall, very good impression of the course.',
        'Is simple and fun.',

        'Very relatable',
        'great, very easy',
        'So far I really like it.',
        "Since I have taken intermediate Spanish in the distant past, this course was a great review: it went quickly, I didn't become bored at all (which is always the case when I attempt to relearn).  The course also forced me to think and speak quickly and correctly.  I would have liked the chants at the end of each lesson to continue past lesson 9, they were fun and helpful.",
        'There’s a LOT fun learning with it',
        "I'm coming back to edit my review after completing all 4 levels of Beginner and 4 levels of Intermediate El Método. This course is BRILLIANT! It deploys spaced repetition and active recall in a way that new words and grammar just stick, and the feeling of acomplishment is so addictive. I woke up an hour earlier every day for the last half a year to study Spanish, and I don't even live in a Spanish-speaking country, I just enjoyed the process so much. Thank you Peter and Jessica for such an amazing course, can't wait for the Advanced El Método! And La Méthode too please:)",
        'Easy to follow',
        'Yes. I like the method of teaching',

        'yani dersler o kadar kolay ki hiç beynimi kulanmama gerek bile kalmıyor pek bir şey de öğrenebildiğimi düşünmüyorum',
        "I found this course to be incredible helpful for my learning style. Following the 'three class rule', which allows for repetition, allowed me to remember the terms better. It's also helpful that the sentences are so varied, making it easier for real word application and easier to make up your own sentences.  The instructor does a great job with pacing and how much information is loaded into each lesson. Really like it, and look forward to more classes!",
        'Really great course, finding it easy to stick with.',
        'Really love this course. I love that we are learning useful words and sentences right from the start and that we are not getting bombarded with grammar which just gets in the way of learning.',
        'wow great',
        'Yes.',
        'The lessons are going the way I had hoped. I do have to pause the lessons in order to formulate the translations. I am hoping that my brain will speed up the process by the end of training.',
        'Ive tried so many types of Spanish lessons and this is by far the absolute best, also NOT boring lol. Thank you, I love it!',

        'fun easy to understand. effective great',
        'Very well presented course. The pacing is very fast  so I had to hit the pause button a lot.',
        "I've tried a lot of courses but this one is from far away the best! The lessons are short and simple to follow. Most importantly, you're not just watching but you will speak all along each lesson and write at the end with the exercises. Speaking out loud and writing is the key to learn a language. Also, as soon as you learn a new word you will use it in a sentence. A lot of courses teach you vocabulary that you don't know how to use afterward. Here it's different as the course is more focused on doing sentences. As an improvement, I would like to be able to download the exercises as it might be very useful to do them several time I think.",
        'Doing very well so far... Worths the price',
        'very easy to understand',
        'Cool!',
        'Simple and well organized. Lots of repetitive speaking, which is really what works.',
        "I've struggled with the Spanish language since I took it in school. I even failed my final exam and was too embarrassed to try again. The few times I did, I got extremely overwhelmed because the strategies used to teach me were too difficult for me to grasp. I'm proud to say that this is the first time I am actually excited to pursue a Spanish language course. I'm eager to begin each new session and even find myself repeating what I learned in my head and aloud during my day. I'm so thankful for Mr. Peter and Jessica for this remarkable program they have developed. It is truly helpful and so easy to follow. Trust me, if it helped me, it can sure help you as well. Give it a try!",
        "It's a good method to learn the language. Thank you!",

        'I like the rhythmic part and pictures, So far so good a little to early to give 5 stars just yet. Also good to hear both of the voices in different speeds and pronunciations.',
        "I have used a few platforms to try and learn Spanish, and this course is far and above the best I've taken.",
        "Very well done.  I'm learning conversational Spanish very quickly.",

        'This starts out very fun and engaging. I really like the chants at the end of lessons. \n\nThanks,\nCarlos',
        "A terrific course. It took me about 3 weeks to get through all the material with a high degree of proficiency, and I'm going to review a bit before I start the next level. Peter is engaging and fun, and the course is simple to do but challenging. I found the time trials in the latter half especially helpful. \n\nI do wish that they would sometimes use the Latin American word (ie carro, computadora) later on after introducing it. Mexico and the US both have significantly more native Spanish speakers than Spain, and that doesn't count numerous other smaller nations. I suppose Peter emphasizes mainland Spain because he has lived there or something, but for many people, it's not the primary goal so it would be nice to see the treatment a bit more even.",
        'I like this course a lot so far. They make it easy to understand as far as pronunciation and have you repeat things so it trains your brain to remember them.',
        'Really enjoyable',
        'I love the rhythmic chant section.',
        'It is amazing!',

        'Love the layout of this course',
        'Great introductory course into the Spanish "Espanol" language. I did study material from outside the course before hand, so most of the stuff that was presented to me wasn\'t as new. However the instructor did utilize his teaching method of listening and responding in Spanish quite effectively. My Spanish certainly has gotten better from only only 4-5 hours of taking this beginner level course. Would strongly recommend to any student looking to build a solid foundations in learning a new language.',
        'Love the music and the rhythm!',
        'yes,  liked the rhythmic music to reinforce',

        "it's good, but my advice is, maybe you should try to put some exclusive video for practicing where there is a lot of question to make us more comfort with the new words or language. but overall it's good, thanks",

        'Awesome',
        "I am thoroughly enjoying this course so far. We took Spanish as a second language in kindergarten and first grade and this is very reminiscent of the way my teacher taught us! I feel like my pronunciation is also much easier to correct with the explanations that these instructors give; pointing out the analogous English sounds for the Spanish R is immensely helpful, especially since I struggle to roll mine so beautifully. Fantastic course so far, and I'm only on lesson 2!",

        "I really enjoyed the first part of El Metodo course. In my opinion, it's very well designed and if you follow Peter's suggestions how to proceed with the course, you'll really be able to learn some basics in just a few weeks. I must say, that I'm not a total beginner (I learnt some Spanish many years ago, when I was in high schol and I really wanted to refresh it after long break), so I'm not able to be objective here. \nFor sure, I'll continue El Metodo!\nAnd one more thing: the fact that the verse from rythmic chant from the first lesson, that goes \"Quiero una Coca-Cola y dos cafes, por favor\" gets stuck in your head till the last lesson, proves that the teaching method works :D And also, that you'll be able to order Coca-Cola and coffee when you're in Spanish speaking country :D",

I thought I would never learn this language, As I just thought I sucked at it and could not motivate myself to study this. I recommend every student struggling with Spanish, to try this course. It will teach you the basics and fundamentals in a fresh new way, that is not the boring old conventional way. Muchas Gracias!',

        'Very clear way of learning.',
        "I am visiting Spain regularly since 25 years now. Sadly, I never managed to actually learn Spanish. I've tried with a couple of book courses, but to no avail, I was able to say more than ordering a coffee or similar. With this course (Level1, Lesson9/10) I've already learned and kept more words as ever before. It's challenging, but within in two weeks I am able to speak complex sentences with necessary words like \"want, need, know etc.\" I am surely far away from mastering the language, but it gives me hope to finally have found a method that works for me and my brain. Looking forward to more lessons!",

Within these last two years, and after many attempts, I gave up because I couldn't find a course that really suited me; nothing was sinking in and I started to lose interest. I then arrived at the conclusion that it wasn’t my lack of ability, but it was the way some courses are taught online.  And although I know much of what I've read and listened to so far, I have decided to start from the very beginning and follow a natural progression. I look forward to the rest of the course and to reaching a level whereby I am learning new language skills.

        'Great course highly recommend it!',
        'It is a great class. The pace and ratio between repetition and new words is perfect for me. I also think that you thought a lot about what is most important to include and what not. For example not teaching plural verb forms at first is brilliant. it removes a lot of complexity and is not really needed in basic conversation. Instead there was more focus on other words that are often used.\n\nSome suggestions to improve:\nThe class would be a bit more fun with some graphics or media. Just text is a bit minimal and can get borring sometimes. The songs for example are nice, but there are not many and just in the beginning.\n\nAll in all it is the best class I know currently and my spanish has improved a lot since I do it. I live in spain since 2 month and doing this class regulary really kickstarted my success.',

        'This Level 1 course is fantastic. I\'ve been doing Duolingo daily for over a year and El Método gave me better understanding of how to say practical things. Example: "Lo siento" ("I\'m sorry") literally means "I feel it," so you can easily transfer that to phrases like "I see it," "I know it," etc. Peter skips a lot of the very-very basics like how to say "man," "woman," etc. and jumps right into sentences you\'ll actually use AND that actually help you understand how to build new sentences from there. Definitely happy I took this course and am excited for Level 2-4.',

I can feel Spanish forming and growing in my mind.  And I am a 54 year old learner.  Make sure you do the little songs at the end and do not feel "silly" doing them.  They are crucial and embed the flow and pattern of the words and structure.  Repeat each lesson three times and do not rush.',

        'Love it. You Should get it and start improving your Spanish . Hasta luego! :)',
        'The addition of a song incorporating the vocabulary at the end of a lesson is genius, a lot of fun, and simply great. Students should certainly perform these for their friends and family as they learn for the lulz.',

        "As a 35 year old, I thought learning Spanish would be much more difficult. I've only gone through the first 10 lessons and I've learned so much! It helps that my Mexican wife is fluent and helps me along the way, especially with the differences between Spanish and Latin-American Spanish. She quizzes me every 4 hours to make sure I'm retaining what I've learned and can apply it in conversation.  I've been wanting to do this my entire life and I'm glad I have chosen this course.\n\nThe method of \"practice\" that is suggested is also great. It's a pseudo-form of Spaced Repetition that allows you to move on to the next lesson with ease, while also being comfortable with the material from the previous lessons. I look forward to the second half of this first course. \n\nMuchas gracias y hasta luego!",

        "I would have preferred to be able to see a human face, rather than just a voice.  This is mostly because the explanations on what to do with your mouth to produce the sounds in a more natural, Spanish way, would be so much better if I could actually see what the lips, tongue and teeth are doing so I can better imitate it.   This is not to take anything away from Isabella.  She's great!",

But what I LOVE so far about this is that the person who recorded her voice did not take out the mistakes she herself made. Showing that there is a human side to this course; im used to a perfect voice with a perfect and extremely boring delivery. This is more like actually sitting in a classroom and listening to a human teacher. Love it",

        "The issue i found was inaccuracy within the teaching. While the instructor was correct that the masculine/feminine often pair well together, she missed the mark on which word was the feminine and which was the masculine. This has me questioning what other errors may be in here that i won't catch as i go beyond my scope of knowledge. The actual teaching style, tone and practice was excellent though!",

        "I'm only at the first few lessons but she is making some very very basic mistakes.\n\nThe present tense (indicative) conjugation is NOT o es e emos en for IR verbs. It is imos for 'nosotros', but she is saying that this applies to both ER and IR verbs. This can be seen in the very first conjugation charts in the first 4-5 lessons. Perhaps she is just simplifying for beginners, but it is clearly just wrong. You should not be putting wrong information as a way to simplify.\n\nAdditionally, 'Agua' (water) IS NOT A MASCULINE NOUN. Every single source on Google indicates that it is a feminine noun. It is just a rare exception where it uses 'el' instead of 'la'. Why? Obviously, because it is very awkward to say 'la agua'. 'El agua' sounds a lot better/more fluid, but this does NOT make the noun masculine. It is just a feminine noun that borrows the masculine article to make pronunciation easier. Another example is the word 'aula' meaning classroom. You say El aula for fluid pronunciation, but it is STILL a feminine noun. \n\nThese are really inexcusable for someone who has studied in Spain for 9 years, considering that spending 2 weeks on Duolingo for Spanish would teach you these things. This is like a native English teacher who does not know what a 'baseball' is.\n\nThe content otherwise has been okay.",

I am very glad I did because one of the hardest things I struggle to learn in spanish is conjugation. Specifically Ser and Estar. It was said in the class by Isabella that teachers typically teach conjugation later and I agree with Isabella. It is crazy. I understand more now just in the hour I have been taking the class then I did in any other class I have taken prior to Isabella's.",

And i enjoyed listening them, except for this course = > Complete spanish course. It is extremely boring, i bought it a year ago but still i did not finish even half. Why i think this is the worst course: \n1) no pictures, no entertaining material. The black background with dark letters will stay during all the 80 hours of lectures. \n2) Instructors change, so during the first half of the course it is one instructor Isabella, and then the instructor changes to another lady. She makes a lot of mistakes, and from how she teaches i can say that she is new or has little teaching experience (this is my opinion).\n3) A lot of repeating content. First 20-30 lectures are great, but then the content repeats and it gets extremely boring to listen for the same things over and over again. \n4) No teaching methodology, all the lectures are build on learning new words, repeating previously learned things. You will be able to learn spanish yourself just by reading the book. I took this course to have an entertaining learning process not just learning words and repeating the content.',
        'Yes, I can say a few words but it will take time.',
        'It matches perfectly my level of Spanish and my speed of learning.',
        "I'm around 50 hours into this course and I can truly say I've gotten a ton out of it. I had learned Spanish in high school about a decade ago, so I knew some basics. But the course goes in-depth on a lot of relevant topics from home, work, school, hobbies, food, travel, etc. It also does a pretty good job of explaining most of the verb tenses. My only gripe with it (and it's hard to complain because the 30+ hours intermediate course was added about a month ago for free, while I had already paid for the course) is that there is an enormous decline in teaching quality from sections 1,2, and 3 to sections 4 and 5 (I'm not up to 6 yet). The 2 instructors in the first 3 sections had a very good grasp of English and they would almost always point out if there was a mistake in the slides while they were going over them. In sections 4-5 the instructor struggles with translating well from Spanish to English and the course has a tremendous amount of errors and lapses between what is seen in the slides and what the instructor says. I spent wayyy more time translating things myself and googling definitions because I couldn't understand what the instructor meant when she translated from Spanish to English, or because there were errors in the slides. That was very rare in sections 1-3. All in all, this course has a ton of relevant information and even with my complaints about the intermediate part, it has helped me improve my Spanish level by a great deal. I think I paid a total of $10 for the whole course. And it's been 2 months, 2 full notebooks of notes, and noticeable improvement in my grammar and vocabulary. As someone who felt overwhelmed with options on how to pick up Spanish after 10 years, I could have done way worse than investing $10 into this course. Hope this was helpful to anyone on the fence.",

        "I´m rather more advanced than this course can offer SO FAR. From my perspective, it is a great resource to dip into. I´m particularly impressed with the fact that it is Iberian pronunciation. Although the double L, 'll' changes from region to region in Spain and so too the 'C' is pronounced as 'S' and 'Y' can have a soft 'J' sound. Where I lived, 'muchas gracias' was pronounced: 'musha grasia... the final 's' silent. The little Spanish I knew before beginning again two years ago (after 40 years) I learnt in Andalucia, where I lived then. Perhaps I'm jumping the gun and pronunciation will arise again quite a bit. I should add, the speaker is very clear and with excellent pronunciation. I'm really glad this course was recommended to me and I'm looking forward to seeing how it progresses. Muchas gracias por la oportunidad.",

        "One of the better courses on Spanish. On Udemy. (The majority of Spanish classes are really low qualities.)\n\nThere was some errors, including the verb conjugations. (Agua is a feminine word, by the way. We say, \"mucha augua\" regardless of what articles we use based on certain grammatical rules.)\n\nMy primary issue is that this course has too many repetitions. Although it says it's 35 hours' content, it's really less than 10 hours. The rest is all repetitions. \n\nIt is a video course. Students can rewind and repeat as they please. There is no reason to repeat the same things, with or without music. :)\n\nI wanted to return the course, but Udemy says I watched too much. Wot. It was all repetitions. :)",

        "FULLY MASTER THE ESSENTIAL  STRUCTURES AND VOCABULARY IN A MATTER OF HOURS, NOT YEARS!Learn basic communicative Spanish with the easy to follow, carefully graded method for complete beginners.The method allows you to:► Talk non-stop from the very start.  ► Produce thousands of practical frases for daily use. \n► Painlessly absorb grammar and vocabulary at  A1 level.  ► Progress without effort, without the need to memorise or study in the traditional sense.ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE METHOD.Tell me and I will forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn . (Benjamin Franklin)EL MÉTODO will allow you to use and understand basic Spanish in a matter of hours, without the need for memorisation or lengthy explanations. This is achieved through a carefully designed method that builds up the language in your mind, step by step, until you are able to form relatively complex sentences with ease.From the very start, you will be forming your own sentences, effortlessly absorbing structures without even realizing it. The method guides you through basic Spanish in a motivating and stimulating way.EL MÉTODO  does not teach you theory, it teaches you to speak Spanish and helps you achieve this in much less time than traditional methods.LEARN NATURALLY AND RAPIDLYIn EL MÉTODO as in real life, learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The process continues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts. Repeated exposure to new words and structures over time, in a wide variety of situations and associations, means that these are acquired for life.HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?EL MÉTODO, level 1, consists of 20 video lessons of spoken Spanish. After every lesson there is a series of written exercises as well as an optional musical task.We will engage you in a spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper. Just talk, talk and talk. You won't stop speaking Spanish from start to finish. This is the ideal system for beginners to learn Spanish. My goal with EL MÉTODO  is for you to become hooked on the method thereby mastering basic Spanish as quickly as humanly possible.Best of luck! ",

        'The course is wonderful! I can learn Spanish in no time.',

        'plutot bien fait , on avance progresivement',
        "I'm enjoying the structure and clarity of the course. However, I do miss the singing (Spanish songs) at the end of each lesson, which you had often at Level 1 for Beginners!",
        'very well done course, introducing gradually and naturally new notions at each lesson.',
        'Impressed hi slowly but surely you aquire the language',
        'A good match for me. I took the course to learn basic Spanish to allow me to order drinks and ask for directions etc. The course has turned out to offer considerably more than this and is very enjoyable.',
        "It's good and getting little hard. Yes, It's match for me.",
        'I like that you learn phrases and why you use certain words in different ways. I’ve used other Spanish learning programs and I learned words but not how to use them in a sentence. Your way is much better!',

        'This course is very approachable and informative.  The repetition and slow building-block approach is awesome for learning.  My only concern, and it is a small one, is that the course focuses on the Spanish spoken in Spain rather than where the majority of Spanish is spoken (i.e. Latin America).  However, Latin American speech is acknowledged and sometimes practiced throughout the course.',

        'Excellent match, I am learning so fast!  he makes it fun, but I also have to work at it to get it.',

        'I love this course. it can seem sometimes easy or slow, but it really helps if we do it as advised at the beginning. Maybe i felt weird first, but after few lessons, i already see the progress, and can only recommend to other beginners. Great method for speaking, and listening.',
        'Thanks so much! If you are serious about learning Spanish, this could be the perfect starting point.',

        'It seems like a good match as I agree with the way it is taught. Although I sometimes get bogged down and have to ask a question or I get stuck with two things mixed up and have to come up with a memory device to tell them apart. I just wish I had a study partner. If you are taking this course I think the buddy system would help a lot.',

        'Yes, the course is interesting for me.',
        'Very pleased with level 2!',
        "this module for Spanish is pretty good. I took Spanish level 1 and its great! Hanley and Jessica give you a lot of the background on the verbs and the words that you needs to put sentences together. This takes the broken Spanish and bridges the words cohesively. They also give you study guides and cheat sheets. My process is to watch the video, go over the definitions page that comes with every lesson, and watch the video on the way to work the next day. and the absolute gem is you will not only learn American Latin but you'll also learn mainland Spain. Ha! I",
        "I really recomend that method for anyone interested in learning Spanish. It's amazing. I wish more language options to be accessible.",
        "Simply amazing, above expectations, learned faster that I thought possible. And super fun. Couldn't for the next lessons. Peter Hanley has hit a jackpot of how to learn faster.",
        'I tried many various "app" learning programs before finally settling on one that was a good fit for me. While it gave me a great ability to learn grammar rules and read/write I was still lacking in my on the spot recall. I added these programs to my Spanish learning routine and wow what a difference. It was like adding gasoline to a flame. My comprehension and recall skyrocketed. I have recommended this program to many and will continue to do so. I\'m excited to move into the intermediate courses.',

        'O curso é muito bom. Estou de fato aprendendo.',
        'I would regard this course and Pimsleur to be the best two courses to learn to speak Spanish in contrast to just knowing Spanish grammar. I believe that until one internalizes sentence structures and is able to reproduce them with ease, one would not be able to speak fluently. When you are speaking you have little time to think about grammar rule. I would rate this course better than Pimsleur for a number of reasons; but the main one is that Pimsleur, being a purely audio course, does not take into account the fact that some learner are visual learners.',

I took Spanish in high school and college and  am now re-learning it with my 10th grade son who is homeschooled, and this is a way better method than how I was taught. I can't believe we are actually able to use it around the house with each other already and we're just halfway through level 2. It is much more like learning it as a child through an immersive process rather than memorizing lists of vocabulary and grammatical rules. I can't recommend it enough!",

Of course this time there is no singing involved (I miss the coca cola sing so much ?) and everything is more focused on learning new structures, words and conjugations. But hey isn't that what we're all here for? To learn this beautiful language? Exactly. \n\nAnd I'm still very happy that my sister recommended this course to me and that I can now enjoy excellent 1 on 1 lessons from Peter and his daughter. \n\nPerfect!",
        'Super helpful. I remember and learn a lot better through listen and repeat. I would recommend this over a language app!',
        "This is working very well for me.  I've tried other more traditional courses and the rules got in the way of my progress.  This course does not over-explain, which is why comprehension is easier.  I accept what I learn and then apply it.  Easy!  The exercises are helpful as are the time-trials.  I enjoy the exercises set to rhythms that are accessible in level 1 and on YouTube, as well.",
        'an excellent course',
        'Because it’s amazing course',
        'Absolutely love this course and being on this journey with you. Thank you so so much :) A+++++',
        'Basics are covered nicely',
        'Yes , it is very Good',
        'Once again. Simple and effective. Great course!',
        'This course is really helpful and it has all the fundamentals which are essential for a beginner.',
        "I think if you know English language it gets somewhat easier to grasp Spanish, but I wouldn't say it's an easy language, it's because Peter sir makes it much easier for us to understand the basics. Looking forward to more courses of Spanish. Interesting language to learn and my main interest lies in watching Spanish series like the famous... La Casa De Papel..  :)",
        "This course has been amazing.  I have found myself thinking in Spanish lately!  The pace of the course is just right for me.  I love that I am constantly made to think Spanish in this activity packed course.  I took Peter's advice and tried not to write anything down.  This has helped.  I just focus on speaking!  Excellent course so far.  I am excited and ready for the remaining levels!",
        'Quite interesting lessons.',
        'Great class, learning Spanish in fun and easy way. Can’t wait to continue with Level 3.',
        'It’s the first course that really teaches me to remember what I learned and I can always go back and do it all over again & again!! ( I’m 66 and apart from liking Spanish music, it keeps my mind going)!',
        'yes i loved it',
        'So happy to have discovered this course ... I’m much more confident to speak now ... Thanks Peter and Jessica',
        'He makes it easy to understand and it’s helped me a lot to learn Spanish',
        'very fast to understand and remember new words level by level. muchas gracias!',

        'The course is easy to follow and consolidates your learning at every step . It has kept me motivated.',
        'SIMPLY AMAZING!',
        "Amazing course for a beginner! On this level though, I thought I was just repeating the things I've already learned and then conjugations came, and I realized learning verbs is not as easy as I thought it was haha pero me gustaba ese curso muchooo. I can't wait for the next ones!",
        'I would not like to be a woman???  You really could not have found a less offensive example to use for a sentence?',
        "magistral . C'est l'adjectif idoine pour décrire ce cours . Bien structuré et progressif . À recommandé ???",
        'Completing each lesson 3 times and the repetition helps confine things to memory. I like the time trials every couple of lessons to reaffirm knowledge.',
        'I am more confident now than I was after completing Level 1. Never knew that I would learn a new language so easily. With proper learning pattern it becomes much more easier to remember things and concepts are so very well explained that they are easily graspable. I never get bored of this and the lessons maintain that enthusiasm to learn and practise more. Thank you very much Peter Hanley Sir for this course.',
        "I really liked how to course was made and how it's taught.I really like the music and the narration style as well as the \nnon-stop speaking of spanish. Muchas Grathias!!!!!",
        'A very good combination of theory and speaking practice',
        'The course is very engaging and not boring at all. The instructors follow great methods of teaching and it makes the language stick in your mind.',
        'The quality of the course is SUPERB. ???',
        'I enjoy the simplicity of this course. They walk you through lots of examples and then test you with very similar examples rather than throwing you curveballs. My only issue is that the videos do not always allow me time to think through the new translation before they solve it for me. For this I simply pause it for the extra second I need.',
        'Fabulous course, learning so much!',
        'I love this course!',
        'This course is so well constructed building up the grammar and the vocabulary so logically and in a way that it sticks in the mind.  Thank you so much for such an enjoyable, confidence-boosting course!',
        'really nice stuff its amazing',
        'I like how this course builds a solid foundation.',

        'the ONLY way to learn a language! Muchas Gracias Peter!',

        'I like this because it is the exact same as the first level, just new terms',
        'Love it and will continue to the third part',
        'An awesome and very insightful course. Although there are some mistakes.',
        'Yes, it was very useful for me! But sometimes, when i answer some questions, i feel like you have not told that thing previous. No worries, keep it up!',
        "I'm in middle school and my teacher suggested me to try this course which I found out was really good for learning Spanish and especially something good to do at home when we have nothing to do in quarantine",
        'Super!',
        'Course is full of info. What I liked more than the course is the way of teaching. My advise is to be confident in level 1 before transferring to this level.',
        'Your course is helping me a lot. Thank you',
        'Level 2 of this course is still quite amazing as it contains a lot of repetitions which helped me to remember the words. However, I wish that we can have 1-2 more seconds to respond to some long sentences in the lecture (although pausing would also do the trick).',
        'I loved the classes. I have also noticed a difference in my speech and listening skills. 100% recommend to anyone willing to learn Espanol.',
        'we are the best learners',
        'I like the class, the pace & content were good for me.',
        "I cant believe how much I have learned and retained from taking El Metodo. I look forward to each new lesson! I recommend this class to anyone who has ever taken Spanish classes before and given up or felt like they didn't get much out of it because I have been there and this has been a completely different experience! I also love the facebook group!! I can't wait to see what Level 3 brings for me tomorrow! Thank you for all of your work Peter and Jessica!!!!",
        "Another brilliant one in the series. The most unique thing about the El Metedo courses is that it keeps you engaged, invovled and you feel like you're making progress with each lessoon and level. Nothing short of a webseries where you'd just want to keep going till the end.",
        'This course has helped us develop a skill which is really nice and so far this course is far above my expectations. It is a good match for me.',
        'very good.',
        'I have lived in medellin for a few months a while back and did some study but this course really helped me with the nuts and bolts of the language in regards to sentence structure and refreshing my mind. It helped me be able to use the vocabulary I had and helps with spanish that is used on a day to day level. I recommend doing these courses to get foundations if you are thinking of going over to a spanish speaking country. I will continue to do the other 2 more courses. Thanks for the heaps Peter.',
        'All around awesome!\nI am learning so much.',
        "The course is easy enough to be accessful for me. Also the excercises at the end of every lesson are useful, though I'd like to see more schemes and moments dedicated to the Spanish grammar",
        'Wonderful course! It all feels very natural and it is fun too! It is easy to rewatch the videos and there is a supplementary group that contains many extra practice resources!',
        'I love this course!',
        'Actually, with a year or so of Spanish already, this course is showing me where I have a good grasp of the language and where I need some refresher.  The fact that I can repeat things multiple time is very helpful.',
        'o nivel 1 ainda tem legendas em português ( mal traduzido) enquanto que o nivel 2 nem se quer tem opção, tendo em conta que percebo de ingles consigo entender',
        'Yes, enjoying the course',
        "The complexity is increasing in level 2 as new material is integrated with things learned previously.  It's a really good challenging course and doesn't get boring.",
        'Amazing. I finally feel I have found something that makes sense to me. This course, like the first course, is simply the best out there. Hands down.',

        'Splendid',
        'Excellent, just like the first course. I’m learning a lot quickly and therefore am a very satisfied learner!',
        'Gradually increasing difficulty level and repetition from the previous classes help to stick it in my memory.  But it would be good to have each lesson a bit stronger and longer with more practice.',
        'Practicable and worthwhile.',
        'Learning Spanish has never been so interesting and fun. Just what I was looking for!!!',
        'A few mistakes in the exercises which throw you off a little and a few new words thrown in before they are explained.  But other than that, this is an enjoyable course and I feel that I am learning a lot',

        'Amazing course !!!',

        'I really like this course. The lessons are in nice bite size chunks and the course has a very nice progression. It is not a chore to do a lesson at all. I enjoy it.',
        'awesome course, highly recommended',
        "I feel I'm making good progress and retaining the learning through the exercises and repetitions, but it's very much a beginners course, which while it suits my standard, means it'll be a long time before I'll be comfortable in Spanish!",
        'Best language course I’ve ever taken! Concise, thorough, logically place lessons, and fun!',
        "It's challenging but that's exactly what I wanted.",
        'right pace and right method',
        "As a polyglot I would recommend everyone to choose this course if you want to learn Spanish. The approach is excellent and I haven't seen such a method of teaching a language before. They clarify very well. I don't know why there are some negative comments about this course - maybe because they were rushing very fast. I would say to do 3 lessons each day.¡Buena Suerte!",
        'Ottimo corso per costruire le basi dello spagnolo.',
        'very good proffessor very useful and fun to learn\nfinished level 2 and going to 3 and 4 and beyond soon\nthanks',
        'Easy and very simple for beginners',
        'Challenging at times but a good pace and level',
        'It’s a very good course. Nevertheless, if you stick to doing it 1h / day (which I did for almost 40 days now) and watch each lesson 3 times and do exercises 3 times and write down the words etc it can become a bit too easy and hence pretty annoying. It goes a little bit slowly anyway, but apparently that’s the secret, to have the solid basics mastered and not be lost in chaos at the very beginning. I think that it’s a very good course and while there certainly are faster methods to learn spanish, I think that this course is very solid and gives strong basics so that everything remains clear in your head. It’s very good for self-studing and.creating a good spanish learning habit. I give it 4,5/5.',
        'This is a remarkable  Spanish course.  \nThis is not like other courses, this course is very particular.\nBesides Mr.Peter is a very generous instructor and he always sends helpful announcements and resources.\nJust one small request can you please change the backdrop music ??? PLEASE !!!!\nmuchas gracias peter sir y jessica\nUn saludo,\nMridula',
        'Love it! Spanish finally makes sense!',
        'Awesome course with systematic teaching method, hopefully the spoken speed for long sentence will be a bit slow so that we could listen and practice more accurately.',
        'amazing class, sat in front of the computer and spoke to my wife in spanish daily',
        'Muy interesante este classe',
        "This is great teaching! There is an option to pause, repeat, speed up if a person needs to, but I've stayed at the default pace, practice a little everyday, and find that I'm retaining everything. Jessica's pronunciations are very helpful. Peter's lessons are well thought out and fun.",
        'great',
        'I was amazed with level 1, but in level 2 the excitement got reduced. This is not because of method which is great already I felt. But, the presentation of the content pattern could be decided in better way like the verb working out pattern for all possible types like -ir, -ar, -er and deviations. So, that students can easily grasp the root of the pattern method. This is completely based on my experience.',
        'As nice as LV1',
        'Perfecto!',
        "I studied Spanish for five years in school and travelled around Spanish speaking countries for a year. Boy, I wish I'd found this course before then! I've learnt far more from it than I ever did in school or using apps like Duolingo and Babbel. El Metédo is based on word frequency which means that right from the start, you're using word that you will actually use in day to day life in a Spanish speaking country. I can't wait to start on level three and eventually master Spanish for beginners!",
        'The course is well structured and its fun to learn a new language at such great pace.',
        'Great',
        'Learning a lot & being challenged. \nTons of enjoyment.',

        'I really love this course as everything is easy to understand!',
        'wonderful course. lot of insights and easy delivery. it is surely recommended. A little research on the side definitely helps.',
        "Yes pretty good... the 1st course didn't convince me. But now, a quarter into this course, I'm seeing the benefits and starting to put things together.",
        'Good pace, and just enough to grasp in each session.',
        'Nice & Easy learning. Enjoyed so far. Looking to level 3 & 4',

        'we need more exercise for practicing. Sentences were all the same in the lecture and exercises. thanks',
        'Exactly what I was looking for.  Did some evening classes years ago and some one-to-one but this is by far the best for me.  Los of speaking and listening',
        'High quality course which teaches the most common words, basic grammar and good pronunciation.  It’s easy to understand and encourages listening, speaking, and makes you actually use the language instead of just memorizing set phrases.',
        'De beste en vlugste manier om een taal te leren!',
        'Another great course. But this time around I felt that there were some areas that were left uncovered. Some I had to guess. The explanations of the underlying logic were not as frequent as they were in Level 1. But still a very good course.',
        'Ich liebe diesen Kurs. Der erste Sprachkurs, den ich jeden Tag und gerne mache. Ich bin entspannt, ich wiederhole, wie es mein Hirn braucht und pimpe nebenbei auch ein wenig mein Englisch, weil Peter so wunderschön englisch spricht.',
        'yes .this course is excellent for anyone want to learn spanish',
        'Yes, this is a good match.',
        "Learning foreign language never been so easy as in this course with Peter and Jessica. Honestly the best method I've ever tried. No pain, no struggles, no wasted hours of vocabulary remembering, so simple and natural. It's just a half of the course but i'm already able to interact with my partners in Spain. I wish all schools use this method to teach students, entire world will speak Spanish within a several months.",
        'Picks up well from level 1. Enjoying the teaching methods. Excited to complete the rest.',
        'Spanish for Beginners Level 2 is exciting to learn. Time Trials are good exercises. They train students, so that learners can communicate well within a given time frame.',
        'I found that the way that this course is structured was effective in allowing me to progress with my Spanish. As a beginner I enjoyed the thorough explanations of the verb conjugations and I really liked how they incorporated new words often. The only minor downfall is that the course gets fairly repetitive but this is nothing to complain about as I truly feel as if this has helped with my language learning.',
        'Amazing course !!\nWe are enjoying it !!',
        'Great!',
        'awesome to good,\nabove expectations,\nkeep it up,I love your courses. So simple',

        'I am loving every bit of it, the Spanish language is love and the way Peter has designed this course is wondrous. I am looking forward to moving to move ahead. I can close my eyes and have full faith in Peter, would be waiting for all his levels starting from basic to advance to come on this platform.',
        "This course really helps break down some learning barriers I've had with Spanish.  The exercises make a lot of sense.",
        'Corso molto utile. Consigliato.',
        'The style of teaching is wonderful. If we give enough time to internalize and do some of our work, it could really help us step up on the language quick',
        'Really good way to learn. After this full course the only thing you have left to do is expand vocabulary whether that be through reading, music etc.',
        'It is very good for intensive practice...The pronunciation, accent and various examples are great! Love that the sessions are short,  not boring and have continuous exercises, both written and oral. I have had classroom courses before, but this worked out best for me. Me gusta! Will purchase level 3 for sure.Highly recommended!',
        'Very enjoyable way to learn Spanish!',
        'I have tried learning Spanish many different ways. This one has proven very effective. Is it because I already have a limited vocabulary and understanding of verbs and such? Quite possibly. Yet, if I was to suggest one method of learning the language, this course is the first on my list.',
        'Because I like this course',
        'yes',
        'very good',
        'kesinlikle, cümle yapısını anlamamda cok yardımcı oluyor, diğer seriyi de alacağım.',
        'Peter is one of the best teachers ever! Learning a new language might seem difficult for many people but he is making it so simple and easy. And he also replied my questions with details in an hour. Thank you Peter! Now it is time to start Level 3. Vamos!',
        'I am studying books but need some interactive learning for conversation.',
        'I think the pedagogy and the pace is just suitable por me.',
        'It is a very good way to learn Spanish. Very different from learning in school or other kind of tutorials. I was able to understand and remember the logic and grammar in a easy and relaxed way. I am so looking forward to my level 3 course now! Thanks Peter',
        'Yes good repetition and keep it top of mind, short training on daily basis is good.',
        "Same approach as in level 1, short (8-10 mins), easy to follow lessons.\n- ? the instructor includes previous topics in later lessons \n- ? few review lessons for important topics\n- ? exercise & transcript files at the end of each lesson (wish the exercises contained a couple more questions outside the lesson's material).\n\nLooking forward to starting level 3 soon",
        'Lo hago!',
        'I had absolutely no knowledge of Spanish and picking up a new language is not easy. If the instructor/ instruction methodology is below par, you quickly tend to lose focus and drop out. This has happened to me in the past, but this course has been a revelation. It has been able to capture my attention and more importantly I am enjoying the course. I am able to go through 5 to 6 lessons without getting bored!',
        'Can be improved by making it interactive.',

        'Bueno',
        'banstante pratico',
        'All round, hands down the best I have used yet.  I find it a challenge learning a language for the first time at 46, I am busy and have lots going on.  But this course is brilliant, you learn conversational Spanish from the very beginning.  Phrases that you can use straight away!',

        "I have tried countless times to learn spanish, via mobile apps, websites, courses, formal education. Nothing has worked besides these courses! \n\nI have UNDERSTOOD more in these courses than any other method. I emphasize understood, because it's no longer memorization, i feel as though i can speak in spanish now.",

        'Cool',
        'The focus of the course is to teach you how to SPEAK Spanish. The technique is to see if you recall it when you need it. The time trials are a great way to decide if you need to repeat the lessons.',
        'I appreciate the lenght of each lesson, its not too long neither too short',
        'Wonderful Course. I recommend it for anyone interested in learning Spanish through a systematic process. As a beginner you will find several materials on internet  to tell you about Spanish, but I recommend to start with one course or one method such as Peter provides here, then after start to explore the language by the method or material you prefer. DO NOT DISTRACT YOUR SELF.',
        "I tried learning Spanish by doing Duolingo every day. While I learned a lot, the app was unreliable (lots of crashes) and I wasn't getting explanations for the \"why\" behind some of the language structures. With these lessons I'm able to understand more of the why and that tends to stick for me more. I'm really enjoying it! On to levels 3 & 4!",
        "I'm doing great. Good that Peter is repeating words and verbs so I remember everything well. I still like it!",
        'This is perfect for me.  I am learning to put together sentences and not just learning words.',
        'con mucho gusto, muy bien',
        'Very clear and fun way to learn.',
        'The way it is taught makes you want to comeback and learn at every opportunity.',
        "I'm repeating the beginners level Spanish that I studied 6 years ago and never used afterwards so it's usually too easy - I'm speeding through it. I speak fluent French and Romanian so that helps a lot too. There should be a speedier course prepared for someone with other another latin language/s.",
        'This Spanish course is a perfect match for me!',
        "It's good as an adjunct to DuoLingo in that it helps you speak. I like the timed tests. I'm also studying vocabulary on Spanish Dictionary.",
        'Basics well taught',
        'Excellent, highly recommended. Thanks team EM',
        "I've been taking this Spanish class so far, and it's been great! Keep me interested and excited. Can't wait to take the next level.",
        'really good for me to learn by myself.\nI will keep practicing and learning with the remaining class.',
        "The first two courses have been great so far. They've been able to fill in the missing pieces in my Spanish studies. My confidence in speaking has also improved. Hope to learn more in Levels 3 and 4.",
        'excellent!',
        "This is great, I've been learning Spanish for years- and I just now learned that the word HOW is not used like I thought it was. It was a great course.. on to the next one!",
        'Easy for me when I want to learn.',
        "After take the second level, I feel much better in Spanish Vocabulary.\nThat's make me feel more confidence than before.\n\nI will continue until level 4.\nThanks Mr. Hanley and Jessica for your courses.\nGreeting from Indonesia.",
        'A',
        'I enjoyed doing Level 2 very much and look forward to do the next level as well! Thank you Peter Hanley for your fantastic help so far. Absolutely great for beginners to master a foreign language.',
        'I am learning so much and so fast.  I understand very well but I have difficulty of answering on time.  I have to repeat often but that helps.',
        'I really like the course, it really helps me a lot',
        'I love EL METHODO! I just do a lesson a day and sinks into my memory!',
        'A great experience!  I love the PDFs.  I can have my daughter and friends question me from the files.',
        'so far it has been a good experience learning the language on this platform. can you suggest some nice songs which I can listen, which may contain the same structures covered so far.',
        'The',
        'The course is very well structured and nicely paced. I love it.',
        'have finished one course of this and I am seeing some improvement in my sentence framing . I still need to think and frame and then speak and still lack ing vocabulary but hoping that gradually I am gonna improve.',
        'si',
        "This course are just like the first one. I've enjoyed learning Spanish a lot through these past two courses. In this course, there were some minor mistakes where the learner is supposed to have time to answer, but the answer shown instead giving no time to think. I was slightly disappointed because I really wanted to answer some questions but then the answer was already on the screen so I didn't even get the chance to think about my answer. I hope these minor mistakes can be fixed for future learners. Also, I noticed (for this course at least) that sometimes when the daughter read the sentences, she would read it very fast whereas other times it would be slowly read. For beginners who haven't gotten used to listening to Spanish, I would recommend recording the voices slower so that learners can clearly hear how the words are pronounced. I understand that it may not be native speed, but for beginners, hearing it slowly helps a lot. Other than that, I enjoy everything. Thanks!",
        "it's been brilliant so far..",
        'I believe it is a good match for me because I can study at anytime and as much as I want.\nSo far I feel I am doing well, I have missed a few lessons because of holidays but I now have a girlfriend that only speaks Spanish so I will have to complete these lessons.',
        'Evet.',
        'Sehr guter Kurs.',
        'Excellent course. Bite sized, relevant content.',
        'learning better than i did  in a classroom',
        'This level II course was a good step up for me from the level I. The contents were practical, and I feel like I can use them on a daily basis. I have learnt a lot and have enjoyed it very much. I am looking forward to taking the level III',
        'I have completed level 1 and have the same expectation from higher levels as well. Peter is such an excellent teacher. Hope others too follow his model of teaching.',
        "I was able to complete the requirements, but expected to be able to have simple conversations with my Spanish-speaking friends. Can't do that yet.",
        "Best course out there. Taking a university course, and learning MUCH more in these courses than I am learning through the uni. And much cheaper!!!  Taking it very slow, but I am finding that slow and steady helps it stick... besides, I'm not learning for the purpose of cramming for a trip, I am learning so that I can know this language for the rest of my life. :) No rush.",
        'Such an amazing course!',
        'Super! enjoyed it a lot!',
        'Great pace, good introduction of basic key terms, accurate and up to date, easy to watch on mobile and on laptop, readily available',
        'Super useful and effective way to learn a language. Practical and interactive.',
        'Amazing as a first level!',
        'This was a good course overall.',
        'Yeap',
        'Perfect in every way...time,repetition,explanations',
        'I was always fascinated about the Spanish language but the rules were kind of strange and awkward to me but this course this course right here makes everything very understandable and I am loving it thank you so much',
        "The exercises in the video are good and I really like the pace and format. A few things that could be improved:\n- the in between written exercises would be better done if the page was interactive, allowing us to submit answers and check them for correctness. \n- the time-trial video would be better if each sentence appeared one by one, followed by the answer so I can verify if I translated correctly, and without the music (although I guess it's easy to mute it during that part I just don't see the purpose for having music during these segments.)",
        'The pronunciation of the letter "C" and the letter "Z" in this course is completely different than the pronunciation of the same letters as I learned in both my high school Spanish classes and also on vocal Google translate. It\'s easier to say the pronunciation that I have formally learned, rather than the kind with the "th" sound. Strange mixup.',
        'Very good',
        'It moves fast but I can stop and back up if needed.',
        'Using as a refresher the formal and informal "you" confused me. Other than that new words and excellent explanations.',
        'Me gusta este clase mucho! Es muy fácil comprender!',
        'I like it’s teaching how to use the word “it” and directional uses of verbs. Other courses I’ve taken don’t teach this info until far too late. Not 5 stars because there no images or videos.',
        'Yes- I needed oral practice',
        'Sehr zufrieden. Macht weiter so!!',
        'Harder than level 1... Funner',
        'Harder than the first one, but feel I am doing OK. Just have to keep practicing',
        'It builds upon itself well',
        "The display needs to have the translated saying and the saying in Spanish....It's too much guessing....I'm learning a lot but I need to see what I'm saying.",
        'The course is easy to follow and teaches in the simplest way possible',
        "Level 2 follows on very neatly from Level 1. It moved along at a steady pace, with new words and constructions being taught in every lesson, but I also really appreciated the occasional repetition of something we had learnt in an earlier lesson. Sometimes, I wished there was a bit more time to speak each sentence ourselves, particularly with the longer and more complicated sentences, but on the whole, the pauses were well-timed. It was lovely to hear both Peter's and Jessica's voices. \n\nMuchas gracias, Peter!",
        'Perfect \nMe gusta !!!',
        'Past study in Spanish helps me with vocabulary and this course drills me more in word order and learning phrasing rather than word to word translation.',
        'Best program I have ever found. Comprendo mucho!',
        'It has been a great tool for this journey. Really like the timing and the right amount of repitition',
        'El mothodos es muy bien!',
        'It’s really helpful',
        'I enjoy practicing daily, perfect for the commute or during housecleaning, and notice my spanish is improving rapidly',
        "It's good how the course goes back a step then pushes on again after a little recap. Good bite size chunks.",
        'Nice but time trial difficult never cope up with it how every i am speaking muy bien :-) muchas gracias.',
        'Beyond amazing! Learning really fast and really well. Would like to practice some more, though',
        'I like it, but there are too many reviews in my opinions. I understand some students benefit from it, but it seems to me that this course has more review than new content.',
        "It's easy to follow and the progressive learning makes me feel accomplished. \nMy friends are even impressed that I can strike out a nice sentence. \nThanks!",
        'Yes i like it but I am not finding the Time Trials on the youtube page under the Playlists. also, not very many videos.',
        'I was an absolute beginner to Spanish and after completing 2 levels of Spanish El Metodo, I have acquired a strong understanding of the basic grammar and usage of most commonly used words taught in the lecture. I am confident of constructing simple sentences using the vocabulary that i learnt in the course so far (Level 1 and Level 2). \nGiven I learn new vocabulary I am confident of constructing basic sentences using the structure taught in this course\nWhat I love- \nI love the Time trial- It is challenging and super fun and a very practical way to test the understanding. If you can not pass the time trial, do not go to the next lecture. repeat until you can complete the time trial successfully\nLecture Sequence- the course follows a sequence that works very well for beginners to slowly build on the Spanish grammar. Every time a new word/structure/concept is introduced at the right time so that the student does not get overwhelmed with too much information\n\nAreas for improvement- Many exercises have sentences repeating from the respective lectures. The exercises would add value if they have new sentences that are not taught during the lectures',
        'I don’t ever leave reviews but both instructors have produced a course that is quick and beautifully organised. Not only does it teach you all the vocabulary you need in a workday situation, but also the structure of the Spanish language. Quickly, you can automatically conjugate verbs in your head and put together sentences accurately at the speed you need for conversation with native speakers. I could not ask for a better course.',
        'a lot of same repetition through the course',
        'I have always found learning a language really hard and always felt like it was just not something I would ever do. This course makes it so easy to learn in a fun and interesting way.',
        'Muy bueno',
        "I'm starting to get this!",
        'I love the repetitive interaction with the courses exercises! As long as you participate and put effort into actually writing down the written exercises and speak the verbal ones out loud, you will start to make more sense of things native spanish speakers say!',
        'a really good course for beginners that works that much',
        'yes it is helping me alot to retain information later',
        "I luckily found Peter's courses a few weeks ago, when searching for courses to refresh my Spanish. I started to learn Spanish a while ago, but unfortunately dropped it again. The first course has already been great -- I already knew some of the covered content from my first attempt of learning Spanish, but this was even a greater motivation to carry on. In the second course now, I had to repeat some of the sections because the topics were new to me and I wanted to fully grasp them. There are some minor mistakes, which you should definitely perceive on your own if you paid attention. As a non-native english speaker, I can only motivate other non-native speakers to take this course, as I had the feeling of learning the real meaning of the words instead of just learning the translation by heart. I am looking forward to level three.",
        'I really enjoy this course!!',
        'Again as always, 5 stars for El método the series that makes you understand and speak spanish in no time. "Feel you\'re winning from the beginning" is their motto, and without doubt, they deliver.',
        'Yes enjoy studying the course, goes at the right pace for me',
        'muy bien',
        'Another excellent course by Peter. All the years of high school training in the Spanish language I took have literally nothing on these courses. I am learning far faster and far more than they have ever taught me and now I feel more confident in going out into the real world and speaking Spanish!',
        'I have completed Level 1 and 2 of this course and thoroughly enjoyed this experience! The most effective language teaching/learning method I have come across so far :) Thank you for making the process so effortless!',
        'In the 2 nd level lectures became harder',
        'I find it very useful for giving confidence in attempting to speak Spanish effortlessly.',
        'Questionable',
        'I have now completed level 1 and level 2 for beginners and feel I am making good progress learning the language. This teaching method is working pretty well so far. I would like to see a little more in-depth writing exercises. Perhaps having sentences for each of the verb conjugations etc. Besides that everything is great. I am looking forwards to starting level 3. Thank you for the work you have put into these courses.',
        'Excellent and very motivational',
        'Dry well done',
        'Great course to refresh or learn basic Spanish. A lot of listening / talking makes it a great deal. Highly recommended.',
        'Excellent, well thought out course that is becoming quite addictive.',
        'Da subito si ha la sensazione di poter formulare frasi complete di uso quotidiano. La parte “teorica” è strutturata in modo interattivo; di conseguenza non è pesante da seguire e garantisce una memorizzazione immediata dei concetti.',
        'Making mistakes es muy bueno',
        'Sehr zufrieden! Nur manchmal - da ich deutsch spreche - sorgt das Umdenken von Englisch in Deutsch für Verzögerung, vor allem beim Futur. Aber da kann ja der Kurs nichts dafür!',
        'Again, El Metodo 2 has given me so many phrases and expression that I can use right away in a real conversation with Spanish speakers. I have learned a lot of verbs, both regular and irregular and Peter has repeated and reviewed them quite often throughout the course. \n\nFrequent time- trial sessions is a great way to review what I have learned and how well I responded to them. There was a time when I wrongly used "vender" and "venir", I knew that I had to retake the lesson before getting ready for the next. \n\nOne more thing, there were mispronounced words and words placed in an incorrect order that sometimes confused me.',
        'Great course! Would highly recommend this to aspiring Spanish speakers.',
        'i watch the spanish news on t.v. and each day i u/s a little more thanks to this course. that is exciting!',
        "I've just completed this course having had completed Level 1 and in all honesty this is the best language course i've found for my learning style. \nI took French in school and none of it stuck but some how Peter has found a way to teach Spanish that works!!\n\nIf you want to learn Spanish then seriously stop searching, you've found the lessons you need. \nI can already watch Spanish videos with Spanish subtitles and understand what's going on (not every word admittedly, but enough).",
        'This was a very good match for me. I need conversational Spanish. I needed to take it from the beginning and have it build.',
        'Easy to learn',
        "It's very thorough, easy and a good way to learn.",
        'I like the course because I am learning and refreshing a lot of vocabulary and at the same time I am practising to speak and pronounce it already. There are however quite a few (grammar) mistakes in the exercise part.',
        'Great Course.  I highly recommend the entire series and I will be continuing on with each new course as it is released.  Great Work Peter!',
        'The course was short but comprehensive.  I thought the sentences were applicable to real situations.\nI thought the tutor was excellent.',
        'Others would also choose',
        "I'm nearing the end of this section of the course, so I feel comfortable leaving my review now. \n\nI have a great deal of respect and appreciation for what Peter Hanley has put together here.  This class is taught in a way where your progression is a steady process, and concepts are taught and then reinforced in later lessons.  I'm beginning to spend a lot less time thinking about what I want to say and just letting the words come out.  I feel very confident that I will be a fluent speaker in time.\n\nAnd speaking of time, please understand that these lessons aren't meant to be raced through. Peter even mentions it often before the beginning of videos. If you don't quite grasp a lesson, go back a few times if you need to. I promise you, it's worth it to do so. You will improve that much quicker.\n\nI mentioned some of the minor issues that need to be cleaned up in my optional comments, but in no way do those take away from what the course is. They can and will be taken care of by Peter now that he's aware of them. I already have his level 3 class ready to go and will continue to support his future contributions.  Buy this course with confidence, it will improve your Spanish speaking.",
        'Very effective',
        "This is the second level that I have taken with Peter. I can't believe how much I actually remember from the lessons and how much I've learned. I have been learning Spanish for years and it's very quite stuck with me. I will be continuing with the courses he offers",
        'Hey guys, love the course! I really like your style and I wish you thought all the courses on udemy haha ! Unfortunately theres a lot of errors so please take the time to review and correct these. Thank you!',
        'Excellent course. Thank you.',
        'Amazing',
        'You can stop the video, but it would be better if the time between seeing the English and speaking the Spanish was more. And then if you could have both the English and Spanish on the same slide.',
        'muy interesante, me gustería el ritmo de aprendizaje',
        'Course moves quickly, and presents information in small incremental bites.  Most of the course time is user interaction, keeping user continuously engaged.',
        'Because it is so easy to use and forces me to participate, I am making much quicker progress than I have experienced previously with more traditional teaching methods.',

        "FULLY MASTER THE ESSENTIAL  STRUCTURES AND VOCABULARY IN A MATTER OF HOURS, NOT YEARS!Learn basic communicative Spanish with the easy to follow, carefully graded method for complete beginners.The method allows you to:► Talk non-stop from the very start.  ► Produce thousands of practical phrases for daily use. ► Painlessly absorb grammar and vocabulary at  A1 and A2 level.  ► Progress without effort, without the need to memorise or study in the traditional sense.ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE METHOD.Tell me and I will forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn . (Benjamin Franklin)EL MÉTODO will allow you to use and understand basic Spanish in a matter of hours, without the need for memorisation or lengthy explanations. This is achieved through a carefully designed method that builds up the language in your mind, step by step, until you are able to form relatively complex sentences with ease.From the very start, you will be speaking and forming your own sentences, effortlessly absorbing structures without even realising it. The method guides you through basic Spanish in a motivating and stimulating way.EL MÉTODO  does not teach you theory, it teaches you to speak Spanish and helps you achieve this in much less time than traditional methods.LEARN NATURALLY AND RAPIDLYIn EL MÉTODO as in real life, learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The process continues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts. Repeated exposure to new words and structures over time, in a wide variety of situations and associations, means that these are acquired for life.HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?EL MÉTODO, level 1, consists of 20 video lessons of spoken Spanish. After every lesson there is a series of written exercises as well an optional musical task.We will engage you in a spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper. Just talk, talk and talk. You won't stop speaking Spanish from start to finish. This is the ideal system for beginners to learn Spanish. My goal with EL MÉTODO  is for you to become hooked on the method thereby mastering basic Spanish as quickly as humanly possible.Best of luck! ",

        'I am very comfortable with the lessons. The transcripts are very important to me in the sense that they help me apprehend the subtilities of the Spanish language vis-a-vis English or French. \nBravo! This method is good for me. I like it very much. \nCongratulations!!!!!',
        'Great!',
        'I love this course! It builds concepts in a way that is easy to understand and remember. I look forward to the next courses!',
        'Can’t easily pause and restart.  Can’t ask questions. (Online version)',
        'This course have been very helpful with moving me forward in my knowledge of the Spanish language and with speaking it! Sometimes it moves a little fast for me but, the teacher even recommends it, I can just repeat the lesson as many times as I need to. Love having control of my own pace.',
        'So good! I really feel like the slogan "feel you\'re winning from the beginning" has been true for me. When will there be an advanced course?!',
        'A',
        'awsome',
        'Totally awesome course that makes learning a new language a super easy and fun task! I am half way through course 3 and can already communicate pretty comfortably in a spanish-speaking country. Highly recommend!',
        'As in the previous course the english sentences are omitting  "it" and "that". While acceptable it makes the process of learning significantly harder. \n\nThe reflexive pronouns are glanced but not properly introduced before requesting a sentence is translated. This makes me "feel like I am failing from the start" when I fail to translate them.',
        'amazing , simple and developed more deeper gradually ,i loved it',
        'Great course.',
        "Such a unique and efficient way to learn Spanish, I'm hooked!\nI wish this method was also available for other languages.",
        'I have loved learning Spanish so much that I want to complete all the courses. Peter who is the course professor, has a way of engaging the student and the course is taught in a very conversation like method. I find it easy to converse with people even though i have just completed 2 levels of the beginners courses.',
        'Practical words that I can use in everyday life... easy to understand.',
        'good',
        "This is a refreshing approach to learning Spanish and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is the best money you will spend to learn the beautiful Spanish language.\n\nMy wife is Colombian and we have been together 5 years. In that time I have always had a goal of learning Spanish. However, more 'traditional' means of learning the language have not worked well for me. I have tried meeting with instructors, self-teaching with 'how-to' books, etc. These all end the same; with me giving up in exasperation. That has all changed with The Method.\n\nThis course is cumulative and teaches you useful words and sentence structure from the very first lesson. Peter offers detailed explanations about the 'why\"behind rules of Spanish grammar. Hearing Peter's daughter( a native Spanish speaker) also helps a great deal in teaching correct pronunciation.Additionally, I am learning Latin American Spanish which has some slight differences, in the course differences between the languages are highlighted so you are able to choose which pronunciation to pursue. The rapid sense of progress you experience in the course helps motivate you to continue. My results have been amazing and I have proof that it works.\n\nI am lucky enough to be in Bogotá Colombia while taking this course, so I have been able to verify that my progress is real. I am staying with my mother-in-law and meeting with my wife's Spanish speaking family on a regular basis. I am able to communicate with them much more effectively then prior to the class. They constantly compliment me on the rapid progress and ask how I am improving so quickly. \n\nIf you are learning Spanish and want a better and more efficient method of acquiring the language, one where your progress is not impeded by boring and useless classes, buy this course today and watch your Spanish level rise immediately! \n\nThank you Peter and Jessica!",
        'Course content is really good.',
        'Very good!',
        "In general very good like the first two courses but this time the exercises that is the written exercises and the time trials weren't not that helpful as they were mostly copied sentences which were already in the lecture of the respective section.\n\nThat was definitely much better in the first two courses!",
        'The course is very easy to understand and I think learning spanish from this course made me relaxed and calm instead of being stressed.',
        'Super in everything!!!',
        'It’s an amazing course. I’m literally glad to purchase this course. It really helpful',
        'très progressif, on avance sans trop de difficulté',
        'I don’t feel as I need to memorize as much since new words and grammar are introduced in small increments.  What you learned in the past lessons are randomly brought up in later lessons.  It’s surprising to me how good my recall is.  Also, I’m challenged to really focus on what is being said.  For example: It’s easy to forget to add a “que” after a verb or totally miss the verb for “can” because your looking where to place the “lo” for “hacer”.  What’s interesting is I am making it more difficult and have to keep reminding myself to keep it simple/easy to be correct.  That’s completely new to me and quite an adjustment.',
        'A very comprehensive way to learn Spanish.  I enjoy the repetition and my pronunciation of Spanish is  quite good according to my Spanish friends!',

        'Best learning Spanish I have found',

        'I am a beginner to the Spanish language.  I live in the Washington D.C. metro area of the U.S.A.   There are many people from Latin America in the metro area.  The effectiveness of this Method of learning Spanish is immediately very useful for me.',
        'I finished level 1 and 2 and currently on the way to level 3. I must say it is just perfect. It doesnt stick to traditional lesson with grammar so in the beginning I felt I was lost but stick to the lesson plan and fully digest 10-12 mins lesson! You will be amazed how luch you get get. If you have any other Spanish book it is just a bonus,a reference. Plus, the instructor answers the question within 24 hours. Highly recommznded!',

        'Good',

The learning process is very enjoyable and manageable, and I fully intend on completing all levels at the beginner and Intermediate levels. My confidence keeps growing in regards to being able to understand and formulate sentences in Spanish. Fully recommend the courses if your goal is to be able to speak and understand Spanish.',
        'I am a beginner and the progression of the method is suitable for my level.',
        'I like this course too much. It is very simple to understand.',
        'I really like the course, it is very interactive and easy to digest grammer. I leave 4/5 stars because the exercises (and time trials) have absolutely the same sentances for translation as in the lessons, which is a bit boring and not so effective for me. It would be really perfect if the sentances were different.',

Thanks a lot for the quality of material and the constant repetition of words and phrases so we can learn and not forger the material we have studied. \n\nLooking forward for the level 4 of Beginners El Metodo.',
        'Again, great course, people are astounded how quickly I’m learning Spanish. At times don’t believe it myself. One note, the time trials in section 3 are in the exact same order as the tests so they’re not as useful as section 2 or 1’s. I feel like I’m just remembering the tests!',

        'Great course, stick to it!',
        "After almost half a year I went back to learning Spanish and what surprised me was that I remember more than half of what I've learnt during first two courses. The third one is of course a great continuation. It really makes learning Spanish easy. It seems as if you're not learning many new words but boy oh boy that couldn't be more wrong. So many combinations and useful vocab repeated over and over again so that you can remember it more easily.\nNow it's time for the fourth part. Let's go!",
        'I like how the foundation is being built for further learning of the language.',

        'Very well designed',

Having a native Spanish female repeat everything is fabulous as it provides perfect pronunciation and inflexion. Highly recommended!',
        'El Método is the best language learning course I´ve encountered online. I am approaching the end of the beginners course and will soon move to the intermediate course. This is the longest I´ve stuck to a course of study for almost 15 years, and me at one time a perpetual student. I am 66 years old now and need this kind of stimulation. The course is structured in such a way that I look forward to each lesson. My confidence levels are rising with each section, after a period of self-doubt going back years. I can cover three lessons a day, but try and stick to just one or two. To get the most out of the course, I regularly revise previous lessons and do a lot of self-study.. I look forward to moving on to the Intermediate level within the next fortnight or so, but not before revising all of the salient points I have learnt. There is also a Facebook group and YouTube channel the student can access where the course designer and tutor, Peter M Hanley, gives advice and answers questions. This communication is very important to the student, the personal touch.  The Facebook page is excellent too for sharing experiences with other students.',
        'ゆっくりしたペースで良い。',
        'Good, but in 4 hours more things can be covered, there is lot of repeatition of things',

        "I love this course and I've been learning from it everyday. Although I may have a suggestion. Is there any chance conversational videos could be included in these courses relevant to what we learn at every level. The reason I say this is while I'm learning to read, write and speak Spanish, I feel I also need to practice in understanding and getting accustomed to listening to the way Spanish is spoken. I try to watch Spanish shows or at least videos of people conversing in Spanish and I find it hard to grasp the accent with the way Spanish is spoken in real life. Some sort of basic training would really help me!",

        "This level introduces some tenses which is where things get complicated. However you are only given a little at a time so you aren't overwhelmed. The key to success is repetition. Take each lesson multiple times and focus on the phrases not the translation i.e. how do I say this in Spanish.\nWhen I try to translate, I stumble over word order, pronouns and conjugations. This is not the fault of the teaching, it is foreign language.",

It is beautifully designed to give the best results and at the same time seems so easy to proceed (though some lessons are difficult, but teaching makes them easy).

        "Well, the ride's been good. Now that I find myself a little deeper into the course though, having arrived at level 4, I think the method could have some adjustments so as to improve its quality. In the beginning, it's very nice to realize you're quickly able to translate phrases by the content that is given to you, but later on, the lack of visual resources and anything other than single phrases gets a little tiring, for me. It's been my first experience learning Spanish though, and both Peter and Jessica are good teachers, so I'll be forever grateful!",
        'Es un pocito facil pero un buen repaso',
        'In level 3 at about Lesson 8 spelling and typographical errors started to be more common, both in the transcripts and on the slides.  " Queire ( L ?)" and "Underdand"( L 11) are typical.\nOn the transcripts the Spanish \'solution\' appeared several times on the left hand side where the English should be.\nOtherwise the course is fine.',

        'By watching at least 1-2 lessons everyday, and practicing it consistently, ive been able to maintain all that i’ve learned from all lessons that i’ve watched. I have a lot to learn but I’ve still learned a lot that i can use already.',
        'Here is my strategy: I finish one level in 20 days. I dont rush. That is the key. First I watch the video. I pause it if the sentence is too long or it is too difficult. then I do the exercises, after that I read the course transcripts without looking their spanish translations(only to check if I made it correct when I need it). I watch the time trail if there is one. I pause the time trail if I need it. Then I watch the video again by skipping time given us to answer. I do the exercises again. I read the course transcripts again. I watch time trail if there is one on 1.75 speed without pausing it. And I watch the video on 2x speed without pausing it. And finally I watch the time trail on 2x speed. In this way I learn very good. I dont forget the words and structures easily. And of course the course is well designed so that you dont forget the words you learn easily by repetitions.',

I've tried every language method you can find.\nThe reason this is best is because in about 10-20 hours (depending on how fast you are), you learn the basic structure of the language. You know how to place the words you learn. \nAfter that it's just up to you to collect as much vocabulary as you want, and you'll know how to use it.",

I have been able to speak so much Spanish in such a short time. I can see that Peter and his daughter Jessica had worked hard in producing these courses and it definitely paid off. This course is worth your money 100% and you would be surprised by how much Spanish you will learn in a short time. Thank you, Peter, for producing such an effective course. I am beyond blessed I have found your courses :)",

And by doing this I have been continually motivated to understand Spanish. So far so good and I just might complete level 4 before the end of the year, but no rush.',

        'Great method. It really works.',

        'exercises need have new sentences different from the lectures',
        'Another excellent course by Peter. Certainly is a bit more difficult than the previous courses but still something that most anyone can go through so long as they master the before material.\n\nWhen he says to not progress unless you have mastered the videos before, he really means it! This is truly a course where you feel you are winning from the beginning!',
        "I can't wait for the intermadiate section already!",
        'Zeer leerzaam. Korte lessen die je dagelijks goed kunt volgen!',
        "I'm In love with this course. All the lessons are linked and well organized. The fact that there is constant reminder of what you learned in the past lessons helps a lot to memorize concepts. I'm surprised by how fast I made progress in Spanish. Thank you Peter and Jessica",
        'Very deliberate and engaging instructor with insight and knowledge.',
        'This course was an amazing another lecture of Peter. However, this time I was hoping to learn more things. On the other  hand, I am thinking that if I make a rush, I am gonna confuse in the future lecture. For this reason, I found the speed of instructor is quite reasonable. Thank you Peter! Hope, those lectures will carry on elementary level too.',
        'I find this course very absorbing, informative and very useful.\nI have learnt a few new things in this course which were not clear to me such as imperatives-difference between positive and negative imperatives!',
        "I never learn Spanish before I take these courses. And I don't know where to start. These courses are really good for beginners like me. It take less than 2 months for me  to complete all 3 levels and am waiting for the level 4. I like the paces of these 3 courses, step by step. Really recommend it. I need more practices, but I feel more confident to expand Spanish through other courses for grammars and vocabulary. \n\n!Muchas gracias!",
        'Another brilliant course by Peter. In the months since i started El Metodo Level 1 i have learn (and remembered) far more Spanish than i ever did of any other language i was taught in school.\nIf you want to learn Spanish then i would really recommend this method!!',
        'I made level 2 and 3 as a refresher - I used to speak basic Spanish well, but forgot it.\nWhat I particularly like about this course is that you actually speak all the time.\n\nI’m giving 4.5 not 5 as it sometimes is a bit boring, you translate exactly the same sentences in the lesson, exercises and time trial. Changing them would make it better.\n\nAnyway, I recommend it.',
        'Just simply fantastic',
        'EXCELLENT COURSE. THANK YOU.',
        'Many typos and no exercises. Thanks a lot for the training though, it was worth it.',
        'Can follow at my own pace. No pressure',
        'I really appreciate the challenge and the in-built progression of this course. It is becoming more difficult which, with perseverance, brings a real sense of achievement. I will now take time to reflect on the things I have learned and then do it again to really embed the learning. Thank you Peter & Jessica.',

        "FULLY MASTER THE ESSENTIAL  STRUCTURES AND VOCABULARY IN A MATTER OF HOURS, NOT YEARS!Learn basic communicative Spanish with the easy to follow, carefully graded method for complete beginners.The method allows you to:► Talk non-stop from the very start.  ► Produce thousands of practical frases for daily use. ► Painlessly absorb grammar and vocabulary at  A1 level.  ► Progress without effort, without the need to memorise or study in the traditional sense.ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE METHOD.Tell me and I will forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn . (Benjamin Franklin)EL MÉTODO will allow you to use and understand basic Spanish in a matter of hours, without the need for memorisation or lengthy explanations. This is achieved through a carefully designed method that builds up the language in your mind, step by step, until you are able to form relatively complex sentences with ease.From the very start, you will be forming your own sentences, effortlessly absorbing structures without even realizing it. The method guides you through basic Spanish in a motivating and stimulating way.EL MÉTODO  does not teach you theory, it teaches you to speak Spanish and helps you achieve this in much less time than traditional methods.LEARN NATURALLY AND RAPIDLYIn EL MÉTODO as in real life, learning is a continuous process, not a series of separate topics. Each new word or structure is preceded by a clear and precise introduction. The process continues as the students use the new word in a variety of different contexts. Repeated exposure to new words and structures over time, in a wide variety of situations and associations, means that these are acquired for life.HOW DOES THE COURSE WORK?EL MÉTODO, level 1, consists of 20 video lessons of spoken Spanish. After every lesson there is a series of written exercises as well an optional musical task.We will engage you in a spoken dialogue that requires no pen and paper. Just talk, talk and talk. You won't stop speaking Spanish from start to finish. This is the ideal system for beginners to learn Spanish. My goal with EL MÉTODO  is for you to become hooked on the method thereby mastering basic Spanish as quickly as humanly possible.Best of luck! ",

I know I’m still a beginner and there’s a long but very exciting way ahead of me, but I’ve been doing this course for weeks now and only missed doing it on two days.

        "Since El Metodo was my first interaction with Spanish, I can't say something like \"this is the best Spanish course I've tried\" because I don't have a frame of reference. However, from my experience learning English and French, I can confidently say that I've never been able to grasp the basics of a languange so seamlessly.\nIf you're trying to learn Spanish from scratch, El Metodo is the place to start!",

        "I give only 3.5 stars this time instead of 5. What i really liked so far was the slow speed of the class. I could do the classes everyday and had the perfect combination of things I already knew and new things I learned. That was very motivating. This time the class is to hard, to fast, and it feels to much like school. I learned with the same effort as the previous classed but couldn't follow. Lost motivation and stopped learning for weeks...",

Already got all the intermediary courses. can't wait to go through them. \nThe course is very well prepared. If you are a complete beginner you def. wont regret getting it.",

El Método has given me the chance to actually put this knowledge to practical use. This is the course I have been waiting for! And definitely worth every penny. Within the next week I will be moving on to the Intermediate level!',

        'It was easy, fun to learn with El metodo. I love it !',
        "I found the small, easily repeatable lessons, seeing, hearing, responding very helpful for review. Also the time trials force me to respond at a near conversational rate. While not yet learning much new information, I'm improving my skills in Spanish. Very valuable. I'm going to try the intermediate courses next. Hope they continue to develop using this method. Downside is that as the levels advance, will have fewer students. Upside is more complete course.",
        "This course is amazing.  I've always struggled learning a second language, but this course has been working wonderfully for me",
        'Good, short explanations. We have waited too long learning past tense.\nThe amount of grammar in-between talking seems to be perfect.',

        'Great course! Also, very happy they updated the course and included time trials all the way thru!',
        "Love it, can't believe I spent so much money on private classes when this is just as good. And less time consuming!",

        'Fordert zum aktiven Lernen auf',
        'Muy bueno.',
        'Good final course in this Beginning Spanish series.  A lot of foundational material to get you started speaking Spanish. Not sure what happened to the short timed sections about half way through, but otherwise I liked this class very much.',
        'O melhor.',
        'It perhaps moves a little slowly and the volume of vocabulary is quite limited. However, I can see that the small number of words helps with the repetition and the sense of familiarity, so the learner can focus on speaking.',
        'I kind of wish that the sentences included more basic nouns rather than the he, she, its, etc. Like real things - shirt, shoes, bed, sheets, cooking utensils, clothes, etc.',
        'The course content was great as always. Just a small feedback though on the music, it tends to be repetitive and annoying at times especially when you have gone though almost 16 hours of these courses. So a change would be helpful.',
        'Great',
        'Better than expected. Good method. Time trials are a bit too fast for non-native English speaking students. Also, during normal translations, I would have preferred to see the English text all the way until the Spanish answer is presented instead of the blank screen for x seconds.',
        'I love the ease of these lessons.  They are well presented and teach Spanish basics in a way that is engaging.  Peter is good at explaining things, so I have learned a lot.  I have also felt supported by the Facebook group that accompanies these lessons!',
        "This course is amazing. I've started that course with zero knowledge but I can understand the sentences in social media accounts or I can choose sentences in Spanish TV-Series and I made a small  dialogue with my friend who speaks Spanish  well so far:) Looking forward to new classes. Muchas gracias..",
        'great and all. but i hope to see more vocabularies added. because there are like only ten or less new vocabs in each level and that is not enough',
        'I never thought that I will be able to get to this level with my Spanish lessons! I have started May 2019 with Level 1 and what a fantastic journey it was up to now! Although I took mostly a few months to finish a level, I still enjoy it tremendously to spend  time in front of my PC to improve my language skills. I am far from fluent, but I for sure know much more that 12 months before!! Thank you Peter Hanley for your input in Spanish el Metodo. Without you, this enrichment for myself would not be possible at all.  Hopefully I will be able to visit Peru and Chile somewhere in future after COVID19 :)',
        "Yes, it's great for getting a grasp of the basics and learning how to speak from the very beginning.",
        'we are enjoying it!!',
        'I left a five star rating because it’s helping me cement what I’ve learnt over the past year with other Spanish lessons also with correcting my pronunciation .',
        "For beginners this is best course and it's totally worth it. I will recommend you to take this course.",
        'Thanks!',

        'I am so excited to start Level 4. It really helps!',
        'Leider waren am Ende keine "Time Trials" mehr nach jeder zweiten Lektion. Die haben wir sehr vermisst.',
        'It is really slow, but the best method on the market so far! :)',
        'Bravo!',
        'Love the learning style. Peter explains the grammar behind learning Spanish so well. Tried other apps like Duolingo but this has by far been the best!',
        '? High quality (as the previous levels).\n? Starts with a review of verbs conjugation (while introducing some new ones).\n\n? Introducing new words in some questions (expecting students to know them already!)',
        'I did all 4 levels of el método and I highly recommend it. I came form literally 0 Spanish to be able to communicate in simple manners. What this course also gave me, is confidence to speak and a lot of fun! If you do it consistiently and follow the teacher’s guidence you will see amazing results. I’m definately going to take the intermidiate course.',
        "Great courses and exceeded expectations. But why the second half of the lessons doesn't have time trial practice? They were useful.",
        'Just perfect. Could not be better!',
        'weeeeeeeeee the best feeling ever',
        'a lot of new information was given. good delivery method.',
        'I had written how great and useful had the first 3 levels been for me. And now finally finished Level 4 and can easily say that Peter is the best teacher out there if anyone wants to start learning Spanish. How does he make it so easy and fun? Have no idea. But I totally love it. And also many thanks to Jessica as well. So, now it is time for some intermediate stuff. Vamos!',
        "This course is BRILLIANT!! I have now completed all 4 levels of Beginner El Metodo and can say that this is in my opinion the BEST Spanish course online (and i've tried a few). Through listening and repetition it forces you to \"pick up\" the language as one might do naturally, as opposed to having to memorize pages of a text book.\nIf you combine this with some reading, watching videos, and personal study of vocabulary in areas that are relevant to you then I truly believe you'll be well on your way to understanding the Spanish language after taking this beginner course.\nThat said, if you're needing to get a DELE certification (or similar) then this course doesn't seem to be created with that in mind, but if you're like me and just want to learn a new language in as easy a way as possible then don't hesitate in picking this course up!!",

        'ı enjoy this course a lot.After all this 4 level everything become more clear.This is probably the best course to learn this language.Money well spend.',
        'I like that I can study this language at anytime. Although I have completed the course I will still keep practicing what I learned. Soon I will continue on to the next level. \n\nMuchas  gracias!',
        'i speak spanish',
        'muchas gracias para el methodo bueno',
        'I\'ve tried app learning and I have done all the Spanish for Beginners. The Complete Methods 1,2,3, and 4 and I would have to say that Spanish for Beginners is the MUCH BETTER learning method.  Yes, I have learned a little Spanish/ and words using the "game" method, but Peter\'s method of teaching actually sticks in my head, and is more useful from day 1. Adios',
        'Easy to follow and learn gradually.',
        'Learned a bunch more. Would have been a better course if there were fewer review lessons in the beginning.',
        'it was pretty good. Wish there was a time trial after Lesson 8.',
        'Still learning',
        'Sometimes it goes slowly. Exercises in video are the same as afterwards',

        'Perfecto, gracias!',
        'IT is good so far',
        "It has taken me the best part of a year to finish all four levels in this wonderful course. It speaks volumes for the quality of the course that it has kept me engaged for so long. You can learn at your own pace and it's just such fun. I think I did each exercise about 3 times during the year. At the end I felt confident enough to converse with people whilst on holiday in South America. That's how good it is. And I have just purchased the intermediate level as well. Thank you Peter and, for this brilliantly designed course. I look forward to future courses as I make my way through the wonderful Spanish language",
        'I totally loved the course !! - all the 4 levels and have purchased the new Intermediate one too  ! The course design keeps you on your toes -which is a good thing .It helps active -easier learning rather  than mugging up words in the language . I totally recommend the beginner series .\n\n Just a quick suggestion : separate lessons could be included to explain a concept thoroughly before starting a lesson on a new topic . Rest all seems perfect !!',
        'yes, i love it',
        'These 4 courses were more than what i expected when i started. I was worried of the hard process of learning a new language and i was very happy to find that i can memorize all the new words and rules in a simpler way. In fact when i go to other courses i find it much more difficult to learn.\n\nNot learning the simplest form of past tense was however a bit disappointing. And when i do try to talk a little in spanish i can only express actions in the present or in the future and the lack of knowing some past tense becomes frustrating.',
        'nice',
        'I love it!',
        'This is an Excellent course. I use the app on my daily commute of 1.5 to 2 hours each day. At this stage, I have worked through all 4 levels of El Metodo. I am not a fluent Spanish speaker just yet but with this course I have learned a lot and think I will get there eventually. Thank you for providing a great resource.',
        "On to the next 'method' course..This is great! And thank you. Now I'm going to try and get the Intermediate course.",
        'I enjoyed all the four levels, and greatly appreciate for the fast responses on my questions. I do love the first three levels better, both the song exercises from level 1 and the time trials from level 2 and 3 are very helpful to review the current courses and previous ones. The level 4 seems a bit in rush, time trials were not completed, which is a great pity.  I do want to point it out that the imperative forms explanation Peter gave at one of the Q&A was such a great explanation that I believe it would be beneficial to include as reference materials for students to download.',
        'Very clear and easy to follow. Some errors in the slides but much better than Level 1-3. Looking forward to Intermediate.',
        'Outstanding from the very first lesson to the end. The Spanish is challenging and fast moving, and yet constantly revisits vocabulary and structures so that it sinks into long term memory. Explanations are short and yet accommodate for all learning styles. The whole journey has been a world-class introduction into a language I’ve learned to love. ¡Gracias por todo!',
        'Its perfect i and very easy to learn, they make it easy i can learn during my work thanks',
        'Peter, you are doing an amazing work, thank you for that. I 100% reccomend it to anyone who wants to painlessly go through the first few steps of language acquisition.',
        'love this course',
        'it is very a good course',
        "I couldn't speak highly enough of this course. The content is relevant to everyday conversation, far more than the usual 'Can I have a beer please?' The presentation is engaging and as the course progresses it draws you in more and more. There is also additional content and advice on Facebook group which is also very helpful.",
        'excellent course, thouroughly enjoying el metodo. i hope you can do the intermediate and advance course',
        "A very nice course is full of excellent content and exercises. The best thing about this course is how easy it is to pick up basic Spanish compared to the years I had to invest to learn even half as much as what the course offers. Really pay attention to what Peter says about mastering the content before continuing and you'll master it without even realizing. \nEL METEDO is *the* standard for learning Spanish and no other method has ever come close to replicating this success. Thank you Peter and hope to see your next course!",
        'A bit too basic',
        'I enjoyed taking the level 4 course. It had a lot of recaps of the previous lessons, which I think helped me build a solid foundation of the basic Spanish language. I am looking forward to the intermediate courses coming out in the future.',
        'Good review but boring',
        'This course is simply awesome. \nI wish they had one for French and or German. \n*Nudge Nudge*',
        'Great course. I am missing the follow-up to the intermediate level though, to learn past tenses',
        'It’s the fourth El Método course that I do and I feel I have learnt a lot. The way things are explained really fits me, more than any book of grammar or standard lesson. Can’t wait to start with the intermediate course!',
        'Excellent course for beginners level.\nWill definitely move onto the intermediate course.\nGracias',
        'Good for learning sentence patterns',
        'Amazing! Dynamic, organised, simple learning!',
        'Great course, easy and clear to follow',
        'It’s excellent!',
        'The course progresses at a manageable pace, not too slow or too fast, and just enough material is covered in short lessons so I still learn a lot!',
        'The sequencing of the concepts was very good. It enabled me to easily remember the concepts from the previous lecture by using words from the previous lectures. One area of improvement could be that the sentences in the exercises are same as that in the lecture. This could be different for the user to gain a diverse understanding of the language',
        'Steeds kleine stukje met nieuwe stof, veel herhaling, goede oefeningen. Ik merk dat ik de taal bijna spelenderwijs machtig wordt.',
        'Very very helpful I am living in Spain and I am finding this course helpful to have a better understanding of Spanish',
        "I earned my self confidence in Spanish because of this course. I am speaking slowly :( (hope I am gonna be faster with more practise)but this whole lectures (from level1 to level4) help me to speak meaningful sentences in Spanish without no doubt, panic or hesitation for grammar mistake. For the first time, I am not considering grammar while I am speaking in Spanish. Cause Peter's lectures prepared the necessary ground for it perfectly and smootly. It is happening by itself. \n\nMillion times thank you Peter and Jessica!!!",
        "I've enjoyed this course from the beginning and was excited to continue my journey when I saw that level 4 released. The general structure of the previous levels remains unchanged, so those that are familiar with this course should feel at home. \n\nLevel 4  begins with a several section review of some of the previously taught concepts. I personally found this incredibly helpful, and I'm sure if I needed the refresher, a lot of other people did too.  By providing an early focus on these things, it provided a strong foundation for us to continue on with the new material.\n\nI think that Level 4 is the most significant release in the entire course. We're now at a point where we've grasped basic concepts and are really starting to get into communicating on a deeper level. Being able to explain ourselves in the future and past tense is exciting stuff and very necessary.\n\nI've also noticed that I'm becoming much quicker at completing the exercises, often coming up with answers with little thought all. I still have a way to go, but the progress I've made since the beginning is night and day. \n\nPeter Hanley has given us another great course and I'm excited to move into the intermediate level. It's worth your time.\n\nSidenote: I recommend people supplement building their vocabulary with one of the many other resources out there. While you do learn a ton of that in this course, the meat of what is being taught is conjugation, sentence structure, etc.  These are the most difficult parts about learning the language and that's why this course has been such a great tool for me.",

        'So far it’s what I expected',
        'Excellent course. Highly recommend for a beginner. Note need to fix number 124 Grabacion 9.2 it plays 8.2.',
        'Very informative',
        'I knew a little Spanish before taking the course. The course helped me to understand the "why" not just the "how to".\n\nThe only phonics is in the first lesson, so correct pronunciation is reinforced by listening to the recordings and the instructors comment.\n\nAt the end of the course I decided to buy the next two levels.',
        'I took an intro class for this teacher and I liked it. So, I purchased this class to learn more. So far, so good!',
        'Well structured and with a reasonable pace, not too slow not too fast for a beginner not totally new to Spanish though.',
        'When looking for a Spanish course to learn, I wanted, not only how to speak Spanish, but also learn the grammar; Nikki provides both in a concise and fun manner. Will take more courses from her after i finish this one.  Good Job Nikki',
        'Excellent work!',
        "Upon my first impressions with the course, i thought that Nikki was... a bit monotonous but after listening, I appreciated it. She doesnt use an overly expressive voice. Just her natural speaking accent. It's great.\nI also appreciate the fact that she doesnt hand hold you. Every activity you do on your own before watching the videos. This has you guessing most of the time but it helps.\nThe PDFs are great, they are designed in a great way and has a lot of information. Each chapter could be done in about an hour or so.\n\nNow, the reason i took away some stars is for one, i noticed you can not access the facebook group she talks about in the videos. Im guessing it is not active anymore but this means you wont be able to practice your spanish or complete some of the final assignments. \nThere are a few errors in her PDFs, but as long as you are watching the videos you will notice she corrected it on the screen, just not the attached files.\nAlso lastly, this course will not make you conversational, at least in my opinion. It's almost enough to get you to an A1 level of spanish on the CEFR. Nikkis other course is enough to obtain A2 level. If she had more courses designed to go past A2, i would probably buy it.\n\n\nIf you catch this course on sale and have access to a printer, it's worth it. You will learn some of natural spanish and not \"textbook spanish\".",
        'As someone with no exposure to Spanish, this course helped me tremendously in getting around in Spain with relative ease. I was able to read and understand signs and ask questions (although understanding the response was a challenge). The suggestion of changing the phone language to Spanish is brilliant! I highly recommend this course to beginners.',
        'easy to follow',
        "This is a fantastic course. I gladly give it five stars. I can not say enough good things about it. The structure and curriculum are clearly laid out, the explanations are great, and the instructor is great to listen to. If you're interested in learning to speak spanish, this is the course to take.",

        'I started learning this course three years ago. At that time, I thought it was too hard to learn and it was not beginner-friendly at all. I was so frustrated at that time. I picked this course up at the begining of this year.  Out of sudden, I felt much better and it seemed not that hard at all. My advice is to take some very basic lessons first then take this course if you are a total beginner.',

I had some basic Spanish knowledge from previous education but didn't trust any of it to still be fresh so decided to start with a beginner course before a trip to Central America. Nikki does a great job with this course! By mixing in writing, listening, reading activities as well as combining lessons containing vocabulary, verbs, rules, etc. you catch on quickly without feeling overwhelmed or defeated by WAY too much information. Also the lessons build on one another in a subtle way so you can realize what is sticking and what is not. At the end of each lesson there is a challenge to use Spanish in every day situations which you can choose to do to take your new Spanish to a conversational, useful level. Thanks Nikki!!",

      description:
        'U.S. Latinx Literature in Spanish remains an understudied field despite its large and vibrant corpus. This is partly due to the erroneous impression that this literature is only written in English, and partly due to traditional educational programs focusing on English texts to include non-Spanish speakers and non-Latinx students. This has created a vacuum in research about Latinx literary production in Spanish, leaving the contemporary field wide open for exploration. This volume fills this space by bringing contemporary U.S. Latinx literature in Spanish to the forefront of the field. The essays focus on literary production post-1960 and examine texts by authors from different backgrounds writing from the U.S., providing readers with an opportunity to explore new texts in Spanish within U.S. Latinx literature, and a departure point for starting a meaningful critical discourse about what it means to write and publish in Spanish in the U.S. Through exploring literary production in a language that is both emotionally and politically charged for authors, the academia, and the U.S., this book challenges and enhances our understanding of the term ‘Americas’.',
